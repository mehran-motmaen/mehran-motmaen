- 👋 Hi, I’m @mehran-motmaen
- 👀I've been a software developer with experience in Linux, Python, Django, Rest Framework, and Ansible since 2016. I enjoy creating one-of-a-kind, user-friendly           applications and have worked with both startups and established businesses. Some of my specialties include back-end development with Python, Django, and Ansible,         software debugging and troubleshooting, and the creation of effective and simple user interfaces. Because of my expertise and experience, I can work independently or     collaboratively in a team setting. I'm eager to continue expanding my knowledge of software development and am constantly trying to keep up with industry                 developments.
